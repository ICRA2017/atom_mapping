# Atom Mapping
Atom Mapping is a ROS package that implements a novel form of 3D mapping, intended for use in real-time robot navigation and planning. In essence, an Atom Map is a generalized occupancy grid that exists in continuous space, and is not restricted to a grid-like structure. Moreover, the general concept is amenable to metrics other than traditional metrics of occupancy, for example it can store the signed distance to an obstacle.

Atom Mapping is developed by **Erik Nelson** and **David Fridovich-Keil**, members of the Video and Image Processing Lab ([VIPL](www-video.eecs.berkeley.edu)).

## Status
This library is currently under development, but we are very excited about this project and we look forward to working on it in the very near future!
